                    <p id="intro_margin">Upland Coffee LLC was founded by Moxie Craig and Sam Robinson in December of 2022. Upland Coffee began when we moved to a small town in Central Vermont.</p>

                <div class="about_story">
                    <p id="intro_margin">Moxie had experience working in beautifully run coffee shops, and slowly
                     was able to transition Sam from his folgers, to beautiful and dynamic, single
                     origin coffees that Moxie had grown to love. After a year of home roasting and with a recently
                    torn ACL injury, Upland was born to give Sam and Moxie a winter project to work on with one another
                    during Moxie's recovery. </p>
